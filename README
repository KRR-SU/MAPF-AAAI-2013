** You need to change run_int.sh for the relevant version of clingo. **

%---------------

The Makefile in this directory contains all instructions to run the tests.

You need the "runlim" tool from http://fmv.jku.at/runlim/

To run all tests in this directory with 8-fold parallelization (as done in
the paper):

  $ make -j 8 -k

To run a single test, give the logfile as target, e.g.:

  $ make Makefile.logs/10-agt-10-pct-obs-10.asp.handy.time

Each value in the table of the paper corresponds to 10 logfiles (the last
number is the instance index) which are accumulated.
